                    With a decade of experience as a Software Engineer, I excel in creating innovative solutions and leading development teams. My career includes roles such as a Web Developer Intern at Domo, where I improved website SEO and readability, and leading front-end design in a hackathon sponsored by ODevs and Stately. I've also managed a top Code Ninjas center, focusing on IT curriculum, team management, and operational efficiency. Outside of coding, I enjoy skiing, longboarding, hiking, and various water activities like surfing and cliff diving.                </div>
